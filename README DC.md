### Covid 19 Vaccination and Cases Analysis (D. Cornea)

Covid 19 is a disease caused by a virus that easily spreads from person to person and affected people from the whole world since end of 2019. Data about the pandemic is available in different forms and it is updated every day. 

The data source used for this Covid Cases analysis project is owid-covid-data.csv from the ourworldindata.org as well as the country_vaccinations.csv from kaggle.com.

According the the owid-covid-data on 15th December 2021 there were 272,205,417 cases recorded worldwide.

Since the pandemic started, countries like United States, India and Brazil recorded more than 22 million cases each.

From the data analysed correlation between new cases and new vaccines or people fully vaccinated is very weak.

However, there is a strong positive correlation between the new cases and new deaths demonstrated by a r-squared of 0.71.

Vaccination data shows that the countries with the highest number of people vaccinated are India with 781MIL people vaccinated, United States 234.6MIL and Brazil 163MIL. However, China, India and United States are the countries with the highest number of people fully vaccinated.

The highest number of cases per million of population have been recorded in Montenegro, Seychelles and Andorra.
People fully vaccinated per hundred had the highest rate in Gibraltar 118.19%, United Arab Emirates	89.34% and Chile 83.82%.

Selected countries used as sample for further analysis had more than 100,000 cases and have a GDP higher than 30,000 and a human development index higher than 0.8.
From the selected countries, France and Germany had high number of new cases in around April but the highest number of new cases had been recorded in November.

The vaccination rate varies with Singapore having 87% of population fully vaccinated, Ireland 76% and Australia 75%.

The cases per hundred rate for the selected countries varies from 21% in Slovenia, 14.5% Israel and only 0.8% in Australia.

When analysing the data whithout considering other factors, the results show that in Australia the number of cases increased when the fully vaccinated population increased also. The correlation factor shows a strong positive correlation. However, there are other contextual factors to be considered before drawing a conclusion on the correlation between vaccine and new cases. These factors would include lockdowns, border closure, social distancing, and others.
